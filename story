**Story**
once upon a time in a forest there lived a Monkey who resided on a Jamoon tree, which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and
rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back next day for more 
fruit, as he loved them.

The monkey wanted to make a cloth for himself using crocodile skin.
